# PokemonCards mini App
This is a small React-Redux application which was created for the recruitment process.
The application was created on the basis of the following guidelines:
* mocking pokemon's list from PokemonAPI, using json-server library
* use create-react-app
* use React with Redux
* add middleware like redux-thunk or redux-saga
* use Saas and/or Bootstrap
* follow AirBnB code styleguide
* add pages pagination

## TL;DR

To get started you need to install Node.js and npm on your computer. Then:

* clone repository or download a zipped file
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* install json-server with `npm install json-server`
* open first terminal and start JSON server with command `json-server --watch db.json`
* open second terminal and start the development server with `npm start`
